# ArchInstall
A collection of files to help facilitate and speed up the installation of an Arch Linux system... The Arch Wayâ„¢!

## THIS REPO IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. PLEASE STANDBY!

## What is this?
This repository, as stated above is a collection of files to help make it faster and easier to install an Arch Linux system the Arch way. Before I go any further, however, I want to be clear about a few things.

## This Repository Is *NOT*
- An Installation Guide
  - Nothing in this repository is meant to help you avoid, bypass or sidestep the official [Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page).

- A Replacement For The archinstall Script
  - The official archinstall script pretty much automates the entire installation process, only asking for user input sparingly. Nothing in this repository automates any part of the official installation process. Even the /scripts directory only contains shell scripts to help automate some post-installation tasks, such as enabling the chaotic-aur or copying dotfiles and pacman hooks into the correct directories, which are entirely optional.
