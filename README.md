# ArchInstall
A collection of files to help facilitate and speed up the installation of an Arch Linux system... The Arch Wayâ„¢!

## THIS REPO IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. PLEASE STANDBY!

## What is this?
This repository, as stated above is a collection of files to help make it faster and easier to install an Arch Linux system the Arch way. I'm also using it as a personal backup of my config files. Before I go any further, however, I want to be clear about a few things.

## This Repository Is *NOT*
- An Installation Guide
  - Nothing in this repository is meant to help you avoid, bypass or sidestep the official [Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page).

- A Replacement For The archinstall Script
  - The official archinstall script pretty much automates the entire installation process, only asking for user input sparingly. Nothing in this repository automates any part of the official installation process.

- To Be Used As Is
  - A few things here can be used as is but most of this will need modifying to suit your own system. Everything here is made specifically for my own hardware.
 
- A Cure For Cancer
  - If I need to explain this maybe you should try Linux Mint...
